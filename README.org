* Instructions
** Prepare to call your mergetool
- Clone this repository and enter the folder
- Type =git fetch --all && git branch -a= to see all branches including remotes
** Create conflicts by merge both Bob and Chen's code
- Go to =master= branch and make sure it's in original status
- Type =git merge origin/bob && git merge origin/chen=. This will cause conflicts.
- Make sure your mergetool is configured, e.g. in =~/.gitconfig=.
- Type =git mergetool= to test your setup.
** Resolve conflicts but ignore all white spaces when comparing lines
- Go to =master= branch and make sure it's in original status
- Type =git merge origin/indent-only && git merge origin/chen=. This will cause conflicts.
- Make sure your mergetool is configured, e.g. in =~/.gitconfig=.
- Type =git mergetool= to test your setup.
- Go back to the first step. This time try run =git merge -Xignore-all-space= instead
